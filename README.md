# KamaalUI

A simple package with some modified SwiftUI components

## Usage

In this little guide, I'll show how to use this package.

Just import `KamaalUI` in your file and use whatever component you want to use. Easy 👍

```Swift
import KamaalUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        KText("HI 🙋‍♂️")
    }
}
```

You can find all the components in this [**playground**](./Previews.playground/Contents.swift)
